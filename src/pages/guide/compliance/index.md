  Step 1: Read your professional code of ethics, legal regulations in Ontario,
  what PHIPPA specifies, and insurance policies


  Starting your own private practice can feel daunting. Common questions that
  come up are: Can I start my own online practice? Where do I start? and what
  rules do I need to follow? 


  First and foremost, it is important for us to make decision based on what we
  think is right. At the same time, there are professional ethics and
  regulations that we need to be informed in. It’s important to be up to date
  with these as they may change. You may want to review these at least once a
  year. 


  I’ve compiled a list of links to important information to review before
  starting an online therapy practice as a Social Worker in Ontario: 


  1. https://www.ocswssw.org/professional-practice/code-of-ethics/

  2. https://www.ocswssw.org/professional-practice/private-practice/ - Look for
  particular guidelines for online therapy. 

  3. https://www.ocswssw.org/about-us/legislation-and-regulations/

  4. https://www.ipc.on.ca/ - IPC oversees the Personal Health Information
  Protection Act (PHIPA), which governs the collection, use and disclosure of
  personal health information by health information custodians within Ontario’s
  health care sector.

  5. Ontario Telemedicine Network for guidance on telemedicine solutions.

  6. Ask your Insurance service provider what is covered for your online private
  practice and what isn’t.

Additionally, if you are working with a group practice, it is important to review the contract and ensure this does not go against your professional’s code of ethics and regulations or even your personal morals and ethics.
